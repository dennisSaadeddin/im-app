## Implementation architecture

**Firebase Configuration (`src/firebase.js`)**: Sets up and initializes Firebase Firestore.

**Redux Store (`src/redux/store.js`)**: Configures the Redux store to manage application state.

**Redux Slice (`src/redux/messagesSlice.js`)**: Defines state management logic for messages, including actions and reducers.

**Message Input Component (`src/components/MessageInput.js`)**: Provides an input box and submit button for adding messages.

**Message Queue Component (`src/components/MessageQueue.js`)**: Displays messages from Firestore in real-time and handles their automatic removal.

**App Component (`src/App.js`)**: Integrates all components and provides the Redux store to them.

**Index File (`src/index.js`)**: Entry point of the application, rendering the root component.

**CSS Files**: Styles for the components to make the UI more user-friendly.

## Building the docker image

In a terminal window, on a machine with Docker installed, navigate to the root directory of the project and run the following command:
`docker build -t message-queue-app .`

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
